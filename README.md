<!-- #### a description of snake, why I chose it, and a screenshot -->
Snake is a classic arcade game, reprogrammed in 1997 by Taneli Armanto of Nokia for the Nokia 6110. I chose to build snake becuase I like playing snake. The __theme__ of this project will honor the original, but take liberties where appropriate (or fun).
