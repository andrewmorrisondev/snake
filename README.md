<!-- #### a description of snake, why I chose it, and a screenshot -->
Snake is a classic arcade game, originally programmed in 1997 by Taneli Armanto of Nokia. Introduced on the Nokia 6110. I chose to build snake becuase I like playing snake. The __theme__ of this project will honor the original, but take liberties where appropriate (or fun).
<!-- # How to Play -->
In this very early stage of development, functionallity is limited. Press space to begin to move the snake around the board, and use WASD to control the direction. __PLEASE NOTE__ The snake will slither off the edge of the play area. This will be patched in later versions.
